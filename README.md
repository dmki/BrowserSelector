# BrowserSelector

Initially a fork of https://github.com/DanTup/BrowserSelector, it was improved to support various scenarios:

* Require VPN for particular websites
* Ignore particular addresses (null browser)
* Loading .wlt files
* Automatic finding of browser(s), if you transfer tool to another computer with different paths

# Setting Up
Grab the latest release and extract to a folder somewhere on your PC.
Open the BrowserSelector.ini file and customise paths to your browsers and domain patterns (see below).
Run BrowserSelector.exe to register the tool in Windows as a web browser.
Open the "Choose a default browser" screen in Windows (you can simply search for "default browser" from the start screen).
Select BrowserSelector as the default browser.
So far, it has been tested on the following:

Windows 7
Windows 8.1
Windows 10 (all editions)
Windows Server 2016 - 2022
